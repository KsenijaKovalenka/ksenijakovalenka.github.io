Topology has shown to be an important tool in classifying solid state systems with peculiar behaviour. 
It is a global property of the system, hence exploring the effects of local perturbations on topological materials is of great interest. 
A way of calculating a topological invariant locally is presented here, shedding light on the relationship between topology and disorder.


Haldane Model
This is a graphene-like tight-binding model with the energy shift at the different sites of the unit cell, which is referred to as the massive 
Dirac Hamiltonian. In addition, there are complex next nearest neighbour hoppings, resulting in electronsâ€™ topological phase. Depending on the 
Dirac mass term M, the system can be a trivial or topological insulator [1]. We added random onsite energies to the model, representing the 
disorder. For a range of mass parameters, increasing disorder strength can lead to the series of phase transitions from trivial insulator to 
topological insulator to Anderson localisation (insulating) state. This can be seen from the LCM calculation for a finite slab of the material 
[2]. Similar behaviour is observed for the BHZ model. We also computed a sum of LCM over the edges for a range of masses and disorder strength to 
produce a phase diagram on the right.
